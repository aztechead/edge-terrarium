# Edge-Terrarium - Dynamic Microservices Platform

A modern, dynamic microservices platform that demonstrates Docker containerization and K3s orchestration through a real-world application. Features a unified Python CLI, dynamic configuration generation, and automatic service discovery. Start with simple Docker containers and progress to full K3s deployment with NGINX ingress routing, secrets management, and monitoring.

## ðŸš€ Recent Improvements

### **Modular CLI Architecture (v2.0)**
- **29.4% code reduction** in main deployment file (1,294 â†’ 914 lines)
- **Clean layered architecture**: CLI â†’ Core â†’ Platforms â†’ Config â†’ Utils
- **Platform separation**: Docker and K3s logic cleanly isolated
- **Intelligent error handling**: Expected failures suppressed with user-friendly messages
- **Enhanced console output**: Technical errors replaced with clear, informative messages

### **Key Benefits**
- âœ… **Cleaner deployments**: No more confusing error messages for expected behaviors
- âœ… **Better maintainability**: Modular structure makes code easier to understand and extend
- âœ… **Improved developer experience**: Clear separation of concerns and logical import paths
- âœ… **Future-ready**: Easy to add new platforms (AWS, GCP) and commands

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd c-edge-terrarium

# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Check system requirements
uv run python terrarium.py check-deps

# Deploy to Docker
uv run python terrarium.py deploy docker

# Or deploy to K3s
uv run python terrarium.py deploy k3s

# Run tests
uv run python terrarium.py test
```

## Key Features

- **Docker & K3s Support** - Deploy to both Docker Compose and Kubernetes
- **Dynamic Configuration** - Auto-generate configs from app definitions
- **Secrets Management** - Integrated Vault for secure secret storage
- **Monitoring & Logging** - Built-in log aggregation and monitoring
- **API Gateway** - NGINX-based routing and load balancing
- **Comprehensive Testing** - Automated testing for both environments
- **CLI Interface** - Unified command-line interface for all operations

## Architecture

The platform consists of several microservices working together:

- **custom-client** - C application handling special API routes
- **service-sink** - Default route handler for unmatched requests
- **file-storage** - Python FastAPI service for file operations
- **logthon** - Log aggregation and web UI
- **vault** - HashiCorp Vault for secrets management
- **nginx** - API gateway and ingress controller
