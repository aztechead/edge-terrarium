# LOGTHON SERVICE
# =============================================================================
# This service exposes the Logthon log aggregation service within the Kubernetes cluster.
# It provides internal cluster access to the Logthon web UI and API endpoints.
#
# Key Concepts:
# - Service: Provides a stable IP address and DNS name for pods
# - ClusterIP: Internal cluster IP address (not accessible from outside)
# - Port Mapping: Maps service ports to pod ports
# - Selector: How the service finds the pods to route traffic to
# - DNS Resolution: Services are accessible via DNS within the cluster
#
# Impact:
# - Provides stable network access to Logthon pods
# - Creates DNS name 'logthon-service.edge-terrarium.svc.cluster.local'
# - Routes traffic to pods with matching labels
# - Enables ingress controller to route external traffic to Logthon
# - Provides internal cluster access to log aggregation UI

  # Selector for finding pods to route traffic to
  # This service will route traffic to pods with these labels
  # Must match the labels in the Logthon deployment pod template
  selector:
    app: logthon                      # Select pods with this label
